When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)

wines <- read.csv('winequalityreds.csv')

names(wines)



```


```{r}
sum(is.na(wines))

```

There are no NA values in our wine data set.

```{r}
summary(wines)

```

Let's investigate the 0 values for the citric acid.

```{r}
sum(wines$citric.acid == 0)

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wines) +
  geom_bar()
```

While there is a disproportionate amount of 0 values, they don't seem too out 
of place. Having no citric acid could also be a marketing strategy for
some wines.

Our data is in tidy form and is complete.

```{r}
#how many wines are there of each quality
ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 8, 1))
```

No terrible, score 1 or 2, or exceptional, score 9 or 10, wines appear on the list. Also, The wines seem to be split into three tiers: those with scores of 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8. Let's create buckets to reflect this.

```{r}
wines$quality.bucket <- cut(wines$quality, breaks = c(2, 4, 6, 8))
table(wines$quality.bucket)
```

Like the above graph showed, the majority of wines are in the middle bucket.

```{r}
#original plot in log form
ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_bar()  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 8, 1)) +
  scale_y_log10()

#normal distribution, check with sd and such
#probably don't need this cause initial graph is pretty normal

```

With so many variables, lets look at a scatterplot matrix to see which variables correlate most with quality scores.

```{r}
ggpairs(wines)
```

The highest correlation is alcohol, then volatile acid, then sulphates

```{r}
ggpairs(wines, columns = 2:4)
```


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wines) + 
  geom_bar(binwidth = 0.1)
```

```{r}
#do this with averages?
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point()
```

It's hard to tell what is happening from this graph.

```{r}
#average quality for each alcohol point
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')
```

That is much better. From the graph we can see that as alcohol increases, so does quality. Let's see if 

###alcohol 5 or more data points

```{r}
alcohol.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(alcohol) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())
alcohol.averages
colnames(alcohol.averages) <- c('alcohol', 'quality.mean', 'n')
alcohol.averages

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(alcohol.averages, n > 4)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(9, 12.99))

```

```{r}
#alcohol averages in each quality bucket

wines %>% 
  group_by(quality.bucket) %>% 
  summarise(mean(alcohol))
```
It appears that bad and average wines have lower alcohol averages than high quality wines. 

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wines) + 
  geom_bar(binwidth = 0.05)
```

```{r}
high.volatile.acidity <- subset(wines, volatile.acidity >= 1)

high.volatile.acidity$quality
```

```{r}
#same graph, but for volatile acids

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')
```

```{r}
wines %>% 
  group_by(quality.bucket) %>% 
  summarise(mean(volatile.acidity))
```

```{r}
#volatile acids more than 5
volatile.acidity.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(volatile.acidity) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())

volatile.acidity.averages
colnames(volatile.acidity.averages) <- c('volatile.acidity', 
                                         'quality.mean', 'n')
volatile.acidity.averages

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(volatile.acidity.averages, n > 4)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wines) + 
  geom_bar(binwidth = 0.05)
```

There are a few outliers here, lets see the quality scores of those outliers.

```{r}
high.sulphates <- subset(wines, sulphates >= 1.5)

high.sulphates$quality
```

```{r}
#same graph, but for sulphates

ggplot(aes(x = sulphates, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')

##count sulphates to see if there are enough at the higher levels
```
```{r}
wines %>% 
  group_by(quality.bucket) %>% 
  summarise(mean(sulphates))
```

```{r}
#this is how to do it!!!!

#average sulphite by quality 
sulphite.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(sulphates) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())

sulphite.averages
colnames(sulphite.averages) <- c('sulphites', 'quality.mean', 'n')
sulphite.averages

ggplot(aes(x = sulphites, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(sulphite.averages, n >4)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.4, 0.9))

#do the same for total.acidity
```

```{r}
#same graph, but for citric acids

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')
```

```{r}

wines %>% 
  group_by(quality.bucket) %>% 
  summarise(mean(citric.acid))
  

```

it looks like the higher ranked wines tended to have more citric acid

```{r}
#nothing interesting  
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity, y = citric.acid), data = wines) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
#not very useful
ggplot(aes(x = pH, y = fixed.acidity), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = quality.bucket))
```


```{r}
#attempt to do for loop to remove values with only 1 result
#total fail, keep for examples, delete after
names(wines)
#make empty vector
five_or_more <- vector()

head(wines)

#for loop example
for(s in wines$sulphates) {
  print(s)
}

#round wine acidity to 1 decimal
wines$total.acidity.rounded <- round(wines$total.acidity, digits = 1)

table(wines$sulphates)

#gives count for each result
acidity.numbers <- as.data.frame(table(wines$total.acidity.rounded))
colnames(acidity.numbers) <- c('value', 'freq')
names(acidity.numbers)
#change from factor
acidity.numbers$value <- as.numeric(as.character(acidity.numbers$value))
head(acidity.numbers)
length(acidity.numbers)
for(i in 1:99) {
  if(acidity.numbers[i,2] > 4) {
    five_or_more[i] <- (acidity.numbers[i,1])
  }
}
five_or_more
acidity.numbers[1,1]



```




```{r}
#still need to get rid of single points
#round total acidity to 1 decimal
wines$total.acidity <- wines$fixed.acidity +
  wines$volatile.acidity + wines$citric.acid
wines$total.acidity.rounded <- round(wines$total.acidity, digits = 1)


ggplot(aes(x = total.acidity.rounded, y = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')
```

```{r}
#total acidity without single points
#average sulphite by quality 
total.acidity.rounded.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(total.acidity.rounded) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())
total.acidity.rounded.averages
colnames(total.acidity.rounded.averages) <- c('total.acidity',
                                              'quality.mean', 
                                              'n')
total.acidity.rounded.averages

ggplot(aes(x = total.acidity, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(total.acidity.rounded.averages, n >4)) +
  geom_point()

```

###citric acid 5 or more data points

```{r}
citric.acid.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(citric.acid) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())

citric.acid.averages
colnames(citric.acid.averages) <- c('citric.acid', 'quality.mean', 'n')
citric.acid.averages

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(citric.acid.averages, n >4)) +
  geom_point()
```



```{r}
#chlorides vs quality
#do with more thqn 5
ggplot(aes(x = chlorides, y = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun.y = 'mean')
```

```{r}
chlorides.averages <- wines %>% 
  group_by(chlorides) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(quality),
            n = n())
chlorides.averages
colnames(chlorides.averages) <- c('chlorides', 'quality.mean', 'n')
chlorides.averages

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides, y = quality.mean), 
       data = subset(chlorides.averages, n > 4)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
#check summaries of each bucket
summary(subset(wines, quality < 5))
```

```{r}
summary(subset(wines, quality > 4 & quality < 7))
```

```{r}
summary(subset(wines, quality > 6))
```
